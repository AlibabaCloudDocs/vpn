# What is VPN Gateway? {#concept_zlb_mvx_bhb .concept}

VPN Gateway is an Internet-based service that securely and reliably connects enterprise data centers, office networks, and Internet terminals to Alibaba Cloud VPCs through encrypted channels. VPN Gateway supports both IPsec-VPN connection and SSL-VPN connection.

## IPsec-VPN {#section_mgt_bgj_dhb .section}

The route-based IPsec-VPN not only facilitates the configuration and maintenance of VPN policies, but also provides flexible traffic routing methods.

You can use IPsec-VPN to connect a VPC to an on-premises data center or connect two VPCs. IPsec-VPN supports IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols. Devices that support these two protocols can connect to Alibaba Cloud VPN Gateway, including devices of Huawei, H3C, Hillstone, SANGFOR, Cisco ASA, Juniper, SonicWall, Nokia, IBM, Ixia, and more.

IPsec-VPN can meet the demands of different scenarios. For more information, see [IPsec-VPN scenarios](../reseller.en-US/Product Overview/Scenarios.md#section_sj2_mcp_dhb).

## SSL-VPN {#section_jdn_sfj_dhb .section}

You can create an SSL-VPN connection to connect a remote client to applications and services deployed in a VPC. When the deployment is complete, you can achieve remote access just by loading the certificate in the client and initiating the connection.

SSL-VPN can meet the demands of different scenarios. For more information, see [SSL-VPN scenarios](../reseller.en-US/Product Overview/Scenarios.md#section_tvk_tcp_dhb).
