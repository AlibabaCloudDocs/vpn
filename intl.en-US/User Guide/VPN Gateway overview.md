# VPN Gateway overview {#concept_zlb_mvx_bhb .concept}

VPN Gateway is an Internet-based service that securely and reliably connects enterprise data centers, office networks, and Internet terminals to Alibaba Cloud VPCs through encrypted channels. VPN Gateway provides both IPsec-VPN connection and SSL-VPN connection.

## IPsec-VPN {#section_mgt_bgj_dhb .section}

The route-based IPsec-VPN enables you to easily configure and maintain VPN policies and provides flexible routing methods for directing traffic.

IPsec-VPN provides site-to-site VPN connection. You can use IPsec-VPN to connect a VPC to an on-premises data center or interconnect two VPCs. IPsec-VPN supports the IKEv1 protocol and IKEv2 protocol, which means any device that supports these two protocols can connect to Alibaba Cloud VPN Gateway, including devices from Huawei, H3C, Hillstone, Sangfor, Cisco ASA, Juniper, SonicWall, Nokia, IBM, and Ixia.

For more information, see [Usage scenarios of IPsec-VPN](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Overview/Scenarios.md#section_sj2_mcp_dhb).

## SSL-VPN {#section_jdn_sfj_dhb .section}

You can create an SSL-VPN connection to connect a remote client to applications deployed in a VPC. After the deployment is complete, you only need to load a certificate in the client to initiate the connection.
