## Billing items {#section_bpp_lwx_wdb .section}

The VPN Gateway provides IPSEC-VPN and SSL-VPN functions, and the billing items for different functions also vary.

Total cost of each VPN Gateway= instance fee + traffic fee + SSL specification fee

-   Instance fee:

    Each VPN Gateway is calculated separately. The instance fee is billed on an hourly basis. The fee is deducted in real time and partial hours are billed as full hours.

-   Network traffic fee

    Each VPN Gateway is calculated separately. Cumulative outbound traffic of a VPN Gateway in an hour is billed. Inbound traffic is not billed. Outbound traffic refers to data transferred from the Alibaba Cloud data center to the Internet. The reverse is inbound traffic.
